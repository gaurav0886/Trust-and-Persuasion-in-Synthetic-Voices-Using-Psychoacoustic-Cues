# Trust-and-Persuasion-in-Synthetic-Voices-Using-Psychoacoustic-Cues  
## Overview  
This project explores how psychoacoustic cues influence trust and persuasion in synthetic voices. The project modifies voice properties and evaluates their impact using user-centered research methods.  

## Features  
- Psychoacoustic feature extraction (MFCCs, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, spectral bandwidth)  
- Trust and persuasion scoring system  
- Advanced visualizations: Bar charts, scatter plots, correlation analysis, spectrograms, and boxplots  

## Installation  
1. Install dependencies using:  
```
!pip install librosa numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy  
``` 
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.  

## Usage  
- Modify the voice samples and analyze the impact on trust and persuasion.  
- Generate spectrograms, correlation metrics, and statistical insights.  

## Results  
This project provides insights into how synthetic voices can be optimized for user trust and persuasion in AI-driven communication.
